If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
 - Given an average valence (happiness) and slightly elevated energy and danceability, I would propose the listener's
   two colors be yellow and purple. Yellow indicates focus, motivation, and self-improvement while purple indicates
   pump-up music

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
- There are additional things that could be measured, including the number of times each song was played
